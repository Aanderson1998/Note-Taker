# Note-Taker

This application was built by a group of 3 students, and took a little under a month to complete. 

This is a note taker application that lets users take notes in the Markdown language. The Note is then rendered to HTML when you view it in the application. There is a UI component to create, update, delete, and read notes. The note itself contained information such as the title, the date the note was created, the date it was last modified, and tags that let the user search for the note later on. This information is then persisted to a file in the backend, so when users exit and come back to the app, their data is still there. 


The frontend of the application was written using the React framework and the web development languages. And the backend of the application used the spring boot framework and java. The application was also hosted on AWS.
